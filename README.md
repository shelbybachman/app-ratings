In this project, I used Python to analyze metrics on mobile apps from the [Google Play](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv) and [Apple](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv) App Stores, to understand what types of apps are likely to attract the most users.
